        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Palawan, Philippines, holds a storied history, shaped by a tapestry of indigenous cultures and colonial influences. Long before Spanish colonization, the island was inhabited by various indigenous groups, including the Tagbanwa, Palaw'an, and Batak peoples. The arrival of Spanish explorers in the 16th century marked the beginning of European influence, leading to the establishment of settlements and the introduction of Christianity. Throughout the Spanish colonial period, Palawan remained relatively isolated, with sporadic interactions with colonial authorities. In the late 19th century, Palawan became part of the American-controlled Philippines, further shaping its socio-political landscape. World War II brought significant upheaval to the region, with Palawan serving as a strategic location in the Pacific theater. In the post-war era, Palawan saw continued development and integration into the broader Filipino nation, while efforts to preserve its indigenous heritage and natural environment remain ongoing.</p>
